{"cells":[{"source":"![Illustration of silhouetted heads](mentalhealth.jpg)\n\nDoes going to university in a different country affect your mental health? A Japanese international university surveyed its students in 2018 and published a study the following year that was approved by several ethical and regulatory boards.\n\nThe study found that international students have a higher risk of mental health difficulties than the general population. Explore the `students` data using PostgreSQL to find out if this is true and see if the length of stay is a contributing factor.\n\nHere is a data description of the fields you may find helpful. The full dataset is in one table with 50 fields and, according to the survey, 268 records. Each row is a student.\n\n| Field Name    | Description                                      | \n| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |\n| inter_dom     | Types of students                                |\n| japanese_cate | Japanese language proficiency                    | \n| english_cate  | English language proficiency                     |\n| academic      | Current academic level                           | \n| age           | Current age of student                           |\n| stay          | Current length of stay in years                  |\n| todep         | Total score of depression (PHQ-9 test)           |\n| tosc          | Total score of social connectedness (SCS test)   |\n| toas          | Total score of Acculturative Stress (ASISS test) |\n\nYour task will be to do the following exploratory analysis:\n\n- Count the number of all records, and all records per student type\n- Filter the data to see how it differs between the student types\n- Find the summary statistics of the diagnostic tests for all students\n- Summarize the data for international students\n- See if length of stay impacts the test scores","metadata":{},"id":"359d243a-25b3-4b7a-a27a-ed1d5eca35ae","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"### **1)Count the number of all records, and all records per student
