## About The Project

3 tables integrated SQL project:
* Socioeconomic indicators in Chicago
* Chicago public schools
* Chicago crime data
The following questions were answered using the techniques mentioned.
1. List the school names, community names and average attendance for communities with a hardship index of 98.
--> Used Joins

2. List all crimes that took place at a school. Include case number, crime type and community name.
--> Used Joins

3. Create a view showing the columns listed in the following table, with new column names as shown in the second column.
--> Created View

4. Returns all of the columns from the view.
--> Used View which I created.

5. Write the structure of a query to create or replace a stored procedure called UPDATE_LEADERS_SCORE that takes a in_School_ID parameter as an integer and a in_Leader_Score parameter as an integer.
--> Created a Stored Procedure

6. Inside your stored procedure, write a SQL statement to update the Leaders_Score field in the CHICAGO_PUBLIC_SCHOOLS table for the school identified by in_School_ID to the value in the in_Leader_Score parameter.
--> Used Stored Procedure

7. Inside your stored procedure, write a SQL IF statement to update the Leaders_Icon field in the CHICAGO_PUBLIC_SCHOOLS table for the school identified by in_School_ID using the following information.
--> Updated Stored Procedure

8. Call the stored procedure, passing a valid school ID and a leader score of 50, to check that the procedure works as expected.
--> Called the stored procedure

9. Update your stored procedure definition. Add a generic ELSE clause to the IF statement that rolls back the current work if the score did not fit any of the preceding categories.
--> Used Transactions
